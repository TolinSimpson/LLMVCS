# Contributing

This repository is currently **proprietary** (see `LICENSE.txt`). External contributions may not be accepted unless explicitly requested by the maintainers.

If you want to help, the most useful contributions are:

- Clear bug reports (include OS, versions, and reproduction steps)
- Feature requests with concrete use-cases
- Documentation improvements (typos, clarifications, examples)

## Development guidelines

- Keep `.vcs` compatibility stable (avoid reordering `vc-database/source/*.txt` entries).
- Prefer small, focused changes with clear commit messages.
- Add/extend tests when changing interpreter parsing/execution or vector search behavior.
